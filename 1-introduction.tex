TODO: motivation, history

To understand the impact that the choice of file types may have on the accuracy of a file fragment classification model, three experiments where conducted. The first uses a small neural network to almost replicate the results that other studies achieved using different models, by following the file type composition that each one used. The second investigates how similar each file type is to the others, to identify those that are easier to classify. The third uses this information to create datasets with easy to classify file types or hard to classify file types, showing how this different compositions affects the model final accuracy.
